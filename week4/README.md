# Week 4: Building a search engine

In this folder, there are 3 Python notebooks, a data folder with 2 files, and a Python script, here are what they do:

- Jupyter notebooks (the ones ending with .ipynb): A documents that explains how searching works, and some exercises for you to create one yourself step by step.
- the `data/` folder: The dataset that we will be using (the database that we search from)
- `preprocess.py`: The Python script that was used to generate the dataset, it is here if you are curious how the dataset is generated, but you don't need to study this file at all

## How to use the notebooks
The below assumes that Anaconda/Miniconda is installed on your computer

1. Download the whole repository as a ZIP file using the instructions in the homepage
2. Extract the contents inside into a directory you like
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook using the Anaconda Explorer/terminal `jupyter notebook`
4. Open the notebooks using the new tab that opens when you do step 3

As usual, if there are any questions, no matter how stupid they may sound, ask on the Slack channel :)
